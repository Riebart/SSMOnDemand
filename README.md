# SSMOnDemand
Scripts for enabling the Amazon SSM agent/service on demand.

1. Have main.sh script download the correct version of SSM
2. Have the main.sh script install and verify connection of the SSM agent
3. Ensure the correct configuration is pulled.
    - Maybe we can hard code a password here so the user has to enter a pass to decrypt the information so it's not sitting open
